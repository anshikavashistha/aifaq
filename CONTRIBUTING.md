# CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES
Welcome to the Hyperledger Labs AIFAQ project! We're excited to have you contribute and help us improve our project. Below are the guidelines to ensure a smooth and efficient contribution process.

## Code of Conduct
Please adhere to our [Code of Conduct](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=41587043). This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the community as well as steps to report unacceptable behavior.

## Getting Started

### Frontend 
First, run the development server:

1.Clone the repository:
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/aifaq.git
cd aifaq/frontend
```

2.Install dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```

3.Start the developemnt server:
```bash
yarn dev
```

4.Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Backend

This software needs GPU for the execution, if you do not have a local GPU you could use a Cloud GPU.Run the AIFAQ API through [lighning.ai](https://lightning.ai/studios) after signup/login, create new Studio (project):

![New Studio Button](/images/new_studio.png)

select the left solution:

![Select Studio Code](/images/studio_code.png)

click on the **Start** button, and rename the new Studio:

![Rename Studio](/images/rename_studio.png)

Then, and copy-paste the github api repo code:

![Copy Paste Code](/images/copy_paste_code.png)

and create two folders:

1. chromadb (it will contains vector database files)
2. rtdocs (it will contains the ReadTheDocs documentation)

That version works with Hyperledger fabric documents (Wiki and ReadTheDocs).

## Usage

### Download ReadTheDocs documentation

Open a new terminal:

![Open Terminal](/images/open_terminal.png)

and download the documentation executing the command below:

```console
wget -r -A.html -P rtdocs https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.5/

```

actually, after a minute we can interrupt (CTRL + C) because it starts to download previous versions:

![Wget Command](/images/wget_rtdocs.png)

Now, we can move into rtdocs folder and move the **release-2.5** content to **rtdocs**. We need to compress the content of the folder, moving there and use that command:

![Compress files](/images/compress_files.png)

and move the readthedocs.tar.gz to the parent directory (../):

```console
- mv readthedocs.tar.gz ..
- cd ..
```

repeating the two commands until we are into rtdocs folder:

![Move Command](/images/move_command.png)

now remove hyperledgerâ€¦ folder and the content:

![Compress files](/images/remove_command.png)

uncompress the file here and remove compress file:

```console
- tar -xzvf rtdocs.tar.gz
- rm rtdocs.tar.gz
```

### Install requirements

Move to the parent folder and execute the command below:

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Activate GPU

After the requirements installation we can switch to GPU before to execute the ingestion script:

![Activate GPU](/images/activate_gpu.png)

then select the L4 solution:

![Select L4](/images/select_L4.png)

and confirm (it takes some minutes).

### Ingest step

Run the ingest.py script:

![Run Ingest](/images/run_ingest.png)

it will create content in chromadb folder.

### Run API

Now, we can run the API and test it. So, run api.py script:

![Run API](/images/run_api.png)

and test it:

```console
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '{"text": "How to install Hyperledger fabric?"}' http://127.0.0.1:8080/query
```

below the result:
